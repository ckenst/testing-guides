# About Test Idea Catalogs

You can develop a standard set of tests for a specific type of object \(or risk\) and reuse the set for similar things in this and/or later products. Marick \(1994\) suggested that testers develop these types of lists and called them test idea catalogs.

Having a good catalog to reference should be part of every software tester + developers toolbox. The following are meant to help with specific and more generalized testing, to provoke ideas for finding failures.
