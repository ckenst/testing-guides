# Data Catalogs

> The following files contain interesting values \(data\) for testing input and output fields.

"Input fields are crazy things. Let's exploit them together."

## Domain Testing Tables

When testing input fields it is often useful to list the variables you are interested in exploring in one of two types of tables:

1. [Classic Equivalence Class table](https://www.dropbox.com/s/eeboxpg00qnocof/Classical%20Boundary%3AEquivalence%20Table%20Template.xltx?dl=0)
2. [Risk Equivalence Class table](https://www.dropbox.com/s/mbyvz8yot4jf37b/Risk%20%3A%20Equivalence%20Table%20Template.xltx?dl=0)

## Other Catalogs:

* [Chris's Images Catalog](https://github.com/ckenst/images_catalog)
* [Falsehoods Programmers Believe About Names](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2010/06/17/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-names/)

### Credits

The input catalog information came from a combination of information from:

* [Lessons Learned in Software Testing: A Context-Driven Approach](http://www.amazon.com/Lessons-Learned-Software-Testing-Context-Driven-ebook/dp/B000S1LVBS/) \(p. 45\). John Wiley and Sons. Kindle Edition. Kaner, Cem; Bach, James; Pettichord, Bret \(2008-04-21\).
* [The Domain Testing Workbook](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00GU2QEV6/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1). Kaner, Cem; Hoffman, Douglas; Padmanabhan, Sowmya.
