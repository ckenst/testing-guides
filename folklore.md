# Testing Folklore

* Every test must have an expected, predicted result
* Effective testing requires complete, clear, consistent, and unambiguous specifications.
* Bugs found earlier cost less to fix than bugs found later. – I might still believe this – only for those bugs that you could reasonably expect to find
* Testers are the quality gatekeepers for a product
* Repeated tests are fundamentally more valuable.
* You can’t manage what you can’t measure.
* Testing at boundary values is the best way to find bugs.
* Test Documentation is needed to deflect legal liability.
* The more bugs testers find before release, the better the testing effort.
* Rigorous planning is essential for good testing.
* Exploratory testing is unstructured testing, and is therefore un-realiable.
* Adopting best practices will guarantee that we do a good job of testing.
* Step by step instructions are necessary to make testing a repeatable process.
